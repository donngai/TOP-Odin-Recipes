Entry 1: Built my first website after following TOP mostly by myself. Used various headers and lists throughout the different pages. Also added links to each recipe and image for each of the recipes. Each recipes contains a description, ingredients, and steps to make the recipe.

Entry 2: Updated a lot of things and added CSS to the HTML to add some style to the page. Used a varietty of properties for each element to manipulate them as well as the margin, padding, and borders.
